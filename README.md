# FCB-SuperSub
This project developed a "Super Sub Recommender" for FC Barcelona, aiming to identify players who make the most significant impact when introduced as substitutes. The analysis leverages three datasets: detailed player season statistics (including substitute-specific metrics), goal logs, and match logs.
